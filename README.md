## If LiveReload is not working

Please enable the following options in IntelliJ IDEA:

- Go to `Settings` -> `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Compiler` and check the box for `Build project automatically`.
- Go to `Settings` -> `Advanced Settings` and check the box for `Allow auto-make to start even if developed application is currently running`.

Install the [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei) extension in your browser and make sure it is enabled.

For more details, refer to [Developer Tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using.html#using.devtools).
